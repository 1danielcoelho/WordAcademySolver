# WordAcademySolver
Simple solver for the WordAcademy Android game.

It uses a list of valid words, as well as the arrangement of the tiles in order to find all possible candidate words for the number of characters desired.

It already contains a list of valid words for Brazilian Portuguese, but the path to another file can be passed as argument.
